        I won't dive too deeply into the details of this website because, well, you're already on it (haha), but I will talk about
        it's development. This website is a single-page application written in an angular4 frontend. It consists of a main
        page with a navigation bar defined in the index.html file. Underneath the navigation bar is a router directive for
        which Angular places all of the applications routed-components. These routed-components include the home page that
        introduces me, a resume page, a projects page, and a separate blog page. I toyed with many of Agularâ€™s features,
        some of, my favorites being the animations and routing animations. I followed the material design guidelines to help
        create a modern-looking website and am always looking for suggestions on how to improve it as this is my first website.
        I decided on the brighter colour-scheme because I think it matches well with my favorite outdoor sport tennis.
