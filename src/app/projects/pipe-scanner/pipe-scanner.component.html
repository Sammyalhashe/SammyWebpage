        Why we called the robot Charlie, I still don‚Äôt know. The name has no relationship with the project, the purpose of the Project,
        or the time in-between when we were designing it. In fact, I only actually know one Charlie, and his name isn‚Äôt actually
        Charlie (it‚Äôs a Chinese friend of mine who happens to go by Charlie). Regardless of the naming, I was part of a group
        project in my second year of university where we built a robot capable of scanning a pipe for ‚Äúradioactive waste‚Äù
        (black dots) and count the occurrences. ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù would then be entered in a competition against other (obviously
        inferior, üòâ) pipe scanning robots. The challenge of this project was to not only build the robot, but to have it
        follow the following constraints:

      </p>
      <ol class="charlieList">
        <li>Be able to scan dots located anywhere of the circumference of the pipe and at any location along the pipe‚Äôs length.</li>
        <li>Not scratch the pipe, this would lead to an immediate disqualification from the competition. </li>
        <li>Include an emergency stop button to halt Charlie in his place.</li>
        <li>To record the number of instances of black dots and record their location relative to the pipe‚Äôs length.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I was the electromechanical member of this group. My responsibility was to communicate with the two other members in my group
        (the circuits member and the programming member). We had team meetings twice a week to update on our individual progress
        and collaborate on future plans. My role as the electromechanical member was to design the structural framework of
        the robot and deal with placing any motors and design circuitry on the skeleton. I had major roles in all four requirements
        above.
      </p>

      <p>
        For requirement one, it was my responsibility to design the skeleton of the robot such that it had access to the entire circumference
        of the pipe for scanning the black dots. I collaborated with my team and people external to my team for ideas on
        how to approach this. I created many sketches detailing my ideas (albeit, not the greatest sketches) to present to
        my team, and we eventually settled on a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù arm that extends from the robot. We investigated the capabilities
        of the infrared sensors that would scan the pipe for black dots and discovered that they were easily powerful enough
        to detect change from far distances. Because of this, we decided that, for convenience sake, this arm didn‚Äôt need
        to fully wrap around the pipe but could leave the bottom uncovered. For requirement two, although we later implemented
        an ultrasonic sensor to help reposition the robot if it ever became too close or too far from the robot, it was my
        responsibility to make the robot go as straight as possible. This involved re-placing the wheels many times, but
        eventually I got it to go straight enough such that the ultrasonic sensor could take over the rest. Requirement three
        was very simple to complete. All this required was for me to place a red button as close as possible to the motherboard
        and let the circuit‚Äôs member handle the rest. For the fourth requirement, we came up with a simple, yet pretty cool
        quick solution. I measured the diameter of the wheels we used. Next, I cut up a circular piece of paper to the same
        diameter as measured. I then coloured the piece of paper in a pattern of black and white slices, effectively creating
        a pedometer when used with an infrared sensor and placed on the inside of the wheel.
