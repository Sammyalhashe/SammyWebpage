            Why we called the robot Charlie, I still don‚Äôt know. The name has no relationship with the project, the purpose of the Project,
            or the time in-between when we were designing it. In fact, I only actually know one Charlie, and his name isn‚Äôt
            actually Charlie (it‚Äôs a Chinese friend of mine who happens to go by Charlie). Regardless of the naming, I was
            part of a group project in my second year of university where we built a robot capable of scanning a pipe for
            ‚Äúradioactive waste‚Äù (black dots) and count the occurrences. ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù would then be entered in a competition
            against other (obviously inferior, üòâ) pipe scanning robots. The challenge of this project was to not only build
            the robot, but to have it follow the following constraints:

          </p>
          <ol class="charlieList">
            <li>Be able to scan dots located anywhere of the circumference of the pipe and at any location along the pipe‚Äôs length.</li>
            <li>Not scratch the pipe, this would lead to an immediate disqualification from the competition. </li>
            <li>Include an emergency stop button to halt Charlie in his place.</li>
            <li>To record the number of instances of black dots and record their location relative to the pipe‚Äôs length.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I was the electromechanical member of this group. My responsibility was to communicate with the two other members in my group
            (the circuits member and the programming member). We had team meetings twice a week to update on our individual
            progress and collaborate on future plans. My role as the electromechanical member was to design the structural
            framework of the robot and deal with placing any motors and design circuitry on the skeleton. I had major roles
            in all four requirements above.
          </p>

          <p>
            For requirement one, it was my responsibility to design the skeleton of the robot such that it had access to the entire circumference
            of the pipe for scanning the black dots. I collaborated with my team and people external to my team for ideas
            on how to approach this. I created many sketches detailing my ideas (albeit, not the greatest sketches) to present
            to my team, and we eventually settled on a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù arm that extends from the robot. We investigated the capabilities
            of the infrared sensors that would scan the pipe for black dots and discovered that they were easily powerful
            enough to detect change from far distances. Because of this, we decided that, for convenience sake, this arm
            didn‚Äôt need to fully wrap around the pipe but could leave the bottom uncovered. For requirement two, although
            we later implemented an ultrasonic sensor to help reposition the robot if it ever became too close or too far
            from the robot, it was my responsibility to make the robot go as straight as possible. This involved re-placing
            the wheels many times, but eventually I got it to go straight enough such that the ultrasonic sensor could take
            over the rest. Requirement three was very simple to complete. All this required was for me to place a red button
            as close as possible to the motherboard and let the circuit‚Äôs member handle the rest. For the fourth requirement,
            we came up with a simple, yet pretty cool quick solution. I measured the diameter of the wheels we used. Next,
            I cut up a circular piece of paper to the same diameter as measured. I then coloured the piece of paper in a
            pattern of black and white slices, effectively creating a pedometer when used with an infrared sensor and placed
            on the inside of the wheel.

            Early in the summer of 2017, I first ‚Äòdipped my toes‚Äô into the world of software by taking an object-oriented design course.
            I did this because I asked my friend from school what would be a good skill to have and he recommended me to
            object-oriented programming. This course didn‚Äôt introduce any traditional ‚Äúcoding-skills‚Äù, but it did introduce
            me to the important foundations used in most software projects used in today‚Äôs industry. This interested me,
            so I decided to go farther and apply these principles to actual projects. However, I wasn‚Äôt very adept at any
            programming languages. I had a MacBook pro at the time, so I decided to try out iOS development in swift by taking
            a course taught by the same individual. This course taught me the basics such as tableviews, delegation, segues,
            and networking using tools such as Alamofire. This course also taught me Swift3.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the introductory skills taught in this course, I decided to try some of them out on a silly app I decided to call ‚ÄúFinder
            Thingy‚Äù. The idea behind this app was to have a personalized list of destinations that I like, and wherever I
            am, I could take out the app and look up the closest location. I used Alamofire to access the Google Maps/Places
            API (with an API key registered in my AppDelegate file) and de-structured the returned JSON to supply the user
            with direction information. This was an introductory app that really wasn‚Äôt that great at all, but I‚Äôm proud
            of the fact that it was my first.

            I won't dive too deeply into the details of this website because, well, you're already on it (haha), but I will talk about
            it's development. This website is a single-page application written in an angular4 frontend. It consists of a
            main page with a navigation bar defined in the index.html file. Underneath the navigation bar is a router directive
            for which Angular places all of the applications routed-components. These routed-components include the home
            page that introduces me, a resume page, a projects page, and a separate blog page. I toyed with many of Agular‚Äôs
            features, some of, my favorites being the animations and routing animations. I followed the material design guidelines
            to help create a modern-looking website and am always looking for suggestions on how to improve it as this is
            my first website. I decided on the brighter colour-scheme because I think it matches well with my favorite outdoor
            sport tennis.
